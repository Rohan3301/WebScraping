# WebScraping
For some of the web scraping scripts I wrote for fun.
I wanted to check the price of a laptop I wanted to buy, on Amazon. Writing a webscraping script seemed interesting which is why I wrote one, and the more elaborate version contains code that sends an SMS to my phone informing of a price drop.
